Conclusion\n","To sum up, house prices in England, and especially in London region changed due to various factor over years. We analyzed some of the determining factor such as traffic flow in that city roads, population, house sales, number of jobs and salaries. After that, we predicted the new year's house prices in London using some machine learning techniques. At the end, we gathered the all information for an aspect of view to understand relevant factors on house prices over years. For further research subjects, more techniques can be implemented to predict more accurate results and some deep learning softwares may help to gather and process the data for the price prediction."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":28.81524,"end_time":"2022-02-21T20:43:26.012112","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2022-02-21T20:42:57.196872","version":"2.3.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
